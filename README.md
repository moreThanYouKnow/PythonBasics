# PythonBasics

Python supports 2 basic concepts: variables and functions.

### How to define a variable?
Example:  
  x = 10  
  s = "Hello, world!"  
  s = 'This is also a string :)'  

Python is a dynamically typed interpreted programming language. Therefore, it is not necessary to specify the type of the variable at all. But if you want to, you can easily do it. For example:  
  x: int = 10  
  s: str = "Hello, world!"
